# Active-Stabilization
LabVIEW code 

The LabVIEW code here was developed for active stabilization

To run the Simulation and Hardware software:

Necessary hardware:
1.	Windows PC with 64-bit architecture 
2.	CUDA enabled Nvidia graphics card (e.g. GTX 1080)

Additional optional hardware:
1. LED and LED controller box (Mightex, BLS-SA02-US)
2. Nanopositioning Piezo Stage with USB 20-bit connection  (Mad City Labs, Nano-LP50-200)

Necessary software:
1.	LabVIEW 64-bit (2014 or above) including:
  a.	Vision and Motion 
  b.	Vision Acquisition Software
  c.	Ni-DAQmx
2.	CUDA 7.5 (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-75-downloads-archive)

To run the simulation software:

1. Download and unzip the folder
2. Open the software (Simulation and Hardware Test.exe)
Ensure the DLL's remain in the path structure
3. Select the approriate tab and run
